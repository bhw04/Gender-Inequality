<h1> Taxi!!</h1> 
<p> In Lebanon, whoever has a car and does not have a job position can be a taxi driver that works for his own. There are many transportation ways and it depends from which regions you are moving. This profession is considered highly men-dominated where you could find young, married, or elderly men practicing it to secure the basics of their livelihood. Nowadays, women have their own cars and drive without any external assistance where Taxi driving is not only about driving and getting people to their destination, however, it has a great responsibility towards the passengers' safety and that of the driver's as well. </p>

<p>The same question comes over and over again, <span id="ah"> Who categorizes the profession and what makes it a male-dominated?</span> I actually did my researches and found out that there are many women in the west that work as Taxi drivers, yet men still dominate it. But in Lebanon, it was not easy to find one. </p>

</p> In North Lebanon, I have never seen a female Taxi driver, but I actually did in Beirut! This gave a sense that regions especially Capital cities give liberty and equality for individuals. While it is not the case because finding one female Taxi driver out of hundreds of males Taxi drivers does not mean what I have just mentioned.</p>

<p> Since I moved to Beirut, I could not feel safe to take Taxi randomly, so there were many available Taxi agencies that help the customer request ride from where he/she is using a phone application such as Uber, Bolt, AlloTaxi...etc. Where all the driver's profile and the car's number become with the customer. Whereas the driver cannot know who will take ride with him/her.</p>

<p> In one of the nights of September, I ordered ride from Hazmieh to Hamra using AlloTaxi trasportation application and I was shocked not because I got a female driver but because it is the first time to see a female taxi driver in Lebanon! She seemed confident and strong independent woman, and I was really impressed. She seemed confident and strong independent woman, and I was really impressed. So, I was so curious to know about how she got this. </p>
<p> <span id="smal"> "I'm divorced and a mother of four. I had to work for my children to secure their needs, and I looked for something in order to get income and to control my time so that I don't leave my kids alone where any job used to take 8-9 hours from my day, so that was the most accurate deciscion that I've taken in my life." </span> Amal said.</p>

<p> In the labor market, employees work as robots as if they are in a factory. Their energy is absorbed, yet the companies are not pleased enough and they still want more and more to generate more profit without caring about the employee's health and life. This is what we call by neoliberalism where no matter what the worker do, he stays on the margin and his only role is to work and work without a minimal appreciation. And for Amal, if she submitted to the company, she would have generated the enough income to secure her kid's needs. So being a Taxi driver would generate the amount she needs, in addition to her ability to manage her time between work and home. She knew that she is integrating in men-dominated field, and she knew that she will receive critiques:</p>
<p><span id="smal">" I wasn't fearing anything the moment I became fully responsible of my house and my kids. My sister said "Are you actually going to be Taxi driver? as the saying goes: wedd your daughter to a monkey with a chain, and never to public transportation chauffeur." in which she referred to this profession as something shameful and doesn't suit a female. But as long as I'm not doing something wrong, I won't care about anything except for my kids. I either ways hear comments."</span></p> 

<p> Sometimes, when you put yourself in a place that you do not belong, you will face many attacks, hatred, and underestimation. But what is important here is how you will shut these attacks down and only care about what you want and what you need. In Mothering, Media, and Precarity, it is mentioned that "Care could be way of resisting exploitation and inequality, because it is about leveling out hierarchies, building empathy and sharing resources and work." And what Amal is doing is a self-care where she is not only caring for herself, but her family and other women that could be afraid of what the society would say about them. But I was wondering if she is not afraid of any risk that might happen especially at night. </p>
<p> <span id="smal"> "It was do or die for me, I didn't have other choices, I didn't want my kids to need anyone else. I do be careful, but this doesn't mean that because I'm woman I'll be exposed to risk, anyone would be. Among 400 Taxi drivers in AlloTaxi, I am the only woman. People used to wonder from a female Taxi driver which was never something familiar to them, but foreigners tell me that it is something normal."</span></p>
<p> I think that there is no valid reason to marginalize woman from being a Taxi driver it's a profession like any others. The skills are met in both sexes and both might be exposed to the same risk. It's neither the gender that qualifies for a job, nor the society that is dogmatic to its patriarchy.</p>
<P><span id="smal"> "I don't consider Taxi driving men's work, because women do drive and it's normal to use this skill as profession. Also, women feel more comfortable and safe with me, they sometimes call AlloTaxi directly to book a ride with to pick their children up from schools or take them from place to another." </span><p>
<p> This moment I realized that Amal is doing emotional and care work which is invisible to her on the first level, and to the customers and the company on the second level. What Amal offers from emotions and care, the other 399 men Taxi drivers do not, or at least people especially women do not feel safe to send their children with men drivers as much as with her. And still, she gets paid less, the company only values the number of rides she does, but they do not take into consideration that Amal is bringing loyal customers to them. Adding to this, not all customers appreciate her invisible labor; because they expect from a woman to be caring. </p> 

<p> Amal is being appreciated by men before women because of her sacrifice and bravery to challenge the system and create new one that permits for a woman to prove herself equally as men. </p>
