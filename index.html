<h2> What is gendered-labor?</h2>
<p>There is a lot of inequalities and differences in the labor market which are related to race, color, nationalities, and even <b>gender</b> where it's known that women make less than men, but <u>how</u>? And to understand why men are more likely to be hired than women is a very important part of the puzzle. </p>


<p>It's so horrible how women are being stereotyped and being put in specific fields according to the societies and social barriers. Yet, these stereotypes look funny at the same time; like the society want to support the woman but based on her <b>abilities and skills</b> so she doesn't put pressure on her. The society assumes that (1) women have a caring nature skilled in domestic work, reception, education, marketing, or social media management. (2) Women are less able to supervise others, because they postulate that women have less physical strength, less willing to travel, and they aren't as much skilled in math and science as men. (3) Women are the future mothers, so it's estimated that they don't have time to work outside, and their household works come first. (4) Men take risk and can manage things, as they're able to put a wheel off the wagon. And if we want to count we won't stop. </p>

<b> These stereotypes fall under the good for women umbrella.</b> 

<h2> Some reasons that show the gender-inequality in the labor market </h2>
<ul>
<li> Women are undervalued and paid less </li>
<li> Women aren't taken seriously </li>
<li> Women are being shortcut from men-dominated careers</li>
<li> Women are being confined in specific domains</li> 
</ul>

<p>	Since very long time ago, there were sit criteria for a woman to work. The society defined the woman as the soft, delicate, emotional, and weak sex that can only be present in specific work fields that aren’t related to the male category which can do better in creative labor, science, and anything that requires strength. No matter what the woman’s preference in labor, she only has limited options based on her social status, age, and even religion! </p> 

<p> In my interviews I intended to shed light on the paradox of how women get marginalized from the woman-dominated professions because of several circumstances or beliefs, and that of a woman that work in a men-dominated profession and viewed as the abnormal. I wanted to show how women try to overcome the barriers and obstacles they face. And how they create value by what they do by demonstrating the ideas of media, labor and gender.</p>
