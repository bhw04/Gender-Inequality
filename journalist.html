<h1> Journalism in Palestine </h1> 
<p>  Statistics Collected by Zippia shows that 53.4% of journalists in the world are women and 46.6% are men, which means that journalism is a female-dominated field. However, in Palestine, it is not the case! As mentioned previously, some labors can't be pursued by women because of specific criteria or circumstances. Although 55% of media students in Palestine are women, the total number of the female journalists in Palestine does not exceed 36% which shows an obvious paradox. <b>So what hinders Palestinian female journalists from practicing their profession?</b>  
<p> Palestine has been occupied by Israel since 1948, where Palestinians were robbed all their rights such as: proprietorship, moving from region to another, living, or sharing their opinion. It is a bit complicated to elaborate how people survive and work there, but it is crucial to know that everything has restrictions. But since we are talking about journalism, it shouldn't be the case to restrict their independency, freedom to speak, or covering the news. </p>
<p> On the other hand, not only citizens are exposed to the risk of death in Palestine, but also journalists! And we saw this in the killing of the famous Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh that was targeted and killed intentionally by the Israeli army. This shows that even the right to deliver the truth is forbidden and exposes you to death. </p>
<p> Consequently, this is one of the main reasons that stop a female journalist from practicing the profession in Palestine, because it is estimated that the woman can't save or protect herself from such risks, as they are not capable for fighting or beating the enemy because they are weak bodies, "because they are women". And if you are thinking that journalism is not only about being on the field, in the case of emergencies, Palestinian journalists tend to multi-task, so even the officer present in the field. Yet, I still do not take this as valid reason because everyone either a man or a woman is exposed to the same risk, and it is not about being physically strong. </p>

<figcaption id="ca"> Shatha Hanaysha-Palestinian Journalist in Jinin (West Bank)</figcaption>
</figure> 
<p> Shatha Hanaysha is a journalist based in Jinin in the occupied West Bank for. She has BA in Arabic and Media and has been a journalist and videographer since 2015. Despite all the discrimination that Shatha faced when she started practicing journalism, she insisted to follow her dream and inspire other girls to do the same. Jinin is a conservative city where people there do not accept what is <span id="ab">abnormal</span> to them. But who specifies the normal? The society itself makes its own rules and put boundaries, they do agree on what please them all and do not on what the feel strange about it. </p> 
<p> <span id="smal"> "I always loved to capture whatever happens in my village, I used to hold my camera and go around the people and the city's corners. People used to look at me strangely as if I'm doing something wrong! It never happened in Jinin for a girl to show up in front of everybody with such bravery."</span></p>
<p> Perhaps it might be called "bravery" as Shatha mentioned to push back the boundaries and to do something that is not familiar to the society. As long as the woman obeys to the society's notions and beliefs, she will never progress and she will always be undervalued and marginalized. Thus, it is either the woman accept and submit to these boundaries or push them back to get what she wants equally without discrimination:</p>
<p><span id="smal"> "Whenever people asked my mom about my major, she used to say "Arabic" without mentioning Media at all; she didn't want people to talk bad about me. Although she knew that I wasn't doing something bad, bad she was afraid of people and their judges. However, as long as I started to do good job in journalism and became more confident of myself, she started to tell people that I study Media, which has become a pride for her as I influenced other girls to study my major</span></p>
<p> 
What Shatha did is something revolutionary, she took care very well of her dream; she challenged the system which shows radical potential/care. By caring about her dream, she was able to secure a new bright future for other women but without facing the same challenge that she did. Others are not forced now to do precarious labor, or at least they can practice journalism without judgments. Adding to this, it is known that Journalism requires to disregarding our emotion, on the same hand, women are known as emotional creatures. So, in the case of any sensitive situation it is presumed that women cannot bear or stand the event which will lead to obstructions in the work. On the other hand, Shatha proved the absolute opposite. Based on her social media accounts, Shatha is overcoming what happened in front of her eyes, she knows that the danger is not near Shirine Abu Akleh or the male journalists, but it is near everyone. She chose to put her emotions aside and prove to the world that a woman can do it.</p> 

<p> Shatha has made a great mark in her region and the Arab world. People now ask about Shatha if she does not present in the field, if she does not go around them holding her camera; this has become strange for them. Shatha was able to resist the stereotypes and traditions to prove to the society the opposite and show them what woman can is not related to her body, feelings or gender. <b> "A woman can do what a man can't" Shatha said</b></p>
